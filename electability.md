What is "electability"?
-----------------------

How much should we concern ourselves with electability?
-------------------------------------------------------
"Electability" has been a commonly heard term in recent elections. It's a vague
term and hard to nail down exactly what contributes to it. The best measure we
have for electability are voter polls, but even those are so inconsistent  and
unreliable that it's not clear who is most likely to win. They are different
from day-to-day and depending on which source you're looking at, not to mention
how you slice up the data.

Unfortunately, the idea of electability can be self-fulfilling, as people
discuss possible candidates, assume their neighbors are more conservative, and
decide to support the more centrist candidate in order to avoid splitting the
vote. A recent poll showed that a large number of Biden supporters would
actually prefer Elizabeth Warren, but are supporting Biden because they think
their neighbors would be happier with him.

The prevailing message pervading our conversations and the mainstream media is
that centrist candidates are more likely to qualify as "electable". The concern
is that we must defeat Donald Trump no matter the candidate, and that a
centrist candidate is most likely to appeal to Trump voters. We can't be sure
without going down two future paths, one with a centrist and one with a
leftist, but we can look back at previous elections. Going back one step, we
have Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump. Hillary was a more centrist candidate
and lost to a more extreme candidate on the conservative side. Back another
election, we have Obama and Hillary in the primaries. Obama being somewhat the
more liberal candidate beat out Hillary there, and then went on to beat John
McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012. We can explore further back, but one
thing we can learn from these elections is that the candidate that won out is
the one that most energized their voting base. There is a relatively small base
of people who are staunch liberals or conservatives. Most people vote for the
candidates they're most energized by, which explains how we could go from the
relatively left leaning Obama to the right extreme with Trump.

- is our democracy broken if we can't vote our values?
- leads to greater compromises in a two party system as the political divide increases
- self-fulfilling: people support a candidate because they think they are "electable", even though they'd prefer another candidate
- from the comments: "claims about it are non-falsifiable"
- bottom line: vote your values
- what comes after the next election?
- think about what reinforces existing power structures

Why is the mainstream media so focused on electability?
-------------------------------------------------------
- it is deeply ambiguous, so it provides a lot of talking material
- ratings
- maybe some bias, wanting someone like Biden to win in order to avoid threatening their business model
  - so many media organizations are owned by the same group

What should the mainstream media be reporting on during the election?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- what our country needs and which candidates best serve those purposes

How important is it for us to defeat Donald Trump?
--------------------------------------------------
- if we don't have a candidate dedicated to solving problems like climate change, we still lose
- Trump is a symptom, not the disease, if we don't focus on the root of the issue, then this might keep happening
  - creeping economic disparity
  - skyrocketing healthcare costs
  - slow erosion of our freedoms to large corporations
  - climate change without accountability
  - there are a lot of power structures in place that don't want things to change.

<Respond to Obama statement about not going to far left>
--------------------------------------------------------
- he ran on and won on a platform emphasizing change
- Trump was elected over less extreme candidates
- the fact that farther left candidates are seeing great popularity

Is a centrist really more electable?
------------------------------------
- Why might centrist candidates be more electable?
- this presupposes that left-right political mindsets are both fixed and linear
  - People's minds change over time
  - People's views on different issues vary pretty dramatically
    - See medicare, which is pretty universally valued, but is also an example of socialism
    - Obamacare also had a fairly high approval rating
- https://www.salon.com/2019/05/06/are-centrist-candidates-really-the-most-electable-it-may-be-the-opposite/
  - "voters aren't really inspired by playing it safe or moving to the center"
- running a centrist candidate runs the risk of alienating liberal voters
- percentages of liberal voters?
- look at candidates who were considered inelectable
  - Donald Trump
    - https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/trump-not-electable-2016.html
  - Barack Obama
- look at candidates who were considered electable
  - Hillary Clinton
- from the comments:
  "John Kerry and Mitt Romney were chosen for their
  electability. Trump and Obama were not. This doesn't prove anything except
  that actual electability is not something we understand so well that it
  should drive our primary voting behavior."
- https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/what-is-electability-774196/
- When it comes to small percentage differences, there is really not a lot we can do to guess who is most electable come election day.
  - look at variability in polls day-to-day, month-by-month, source-by-source
  - "People and voting behavior are far too complex to boil down to one simplistic motivating factor." (from comments)
- Who can mobilize voters?

Is a centrist really better than Trump?
---------------------------------------
- think about the issues at play: climate change, healthcare, economic disparity, international conflict

Does the mainstream media boost centrist candidates?

Could Bernie have won in 2016 against Trump?
--------------------------------------------
- https://www.npr.org/2017/08/24/545812242/1-in-10-sanders-primary-voters-ended-up-supporting-trump-survey-finds

Is Bernie under-performing among non-whites?
--------------------------------------------

Is it morally right for us to support a candidate just because they're electable?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Should we support a candidate who is male because we think others are sexist?
- (verify) it's a commonly held belief that there are major flaws in our political system, though there is certainly disagreement as to what needs to happen to fix it
- focusing on centrist candidates who are considered safer and more electable serves to reinforce the system that has put us in this place to begin with
- If we don't elect candidates who are committed to solving the huge problems that we are facing then we are still losing out. Climate change is an emergency and we need people in government who will make it an immediate priority over preserving existing power structures.


How much should we weigh age in the candidates that we support?
---------------------------------------------------------------
- better someone who's values you share than a younger candidate who's values you don't share
- what are the risks?
  - not up to the job of the presidency
    - problem is, this is vague and really hard to pin down
  - dies or is hospitalized as a president
- important to keep in mind that Biden is only 1 year younger than Bernie. Warren is 70

What about all of the people who say they would never vote for a socialist?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- what people say and what they do are two different things

What's the difference between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren?

How could we improve our election systems?
